# Kana Kaline Menu System

This is a simple menu application that consists of three components:

1. A responsive menu web page to be displayed on the television or iPads
2. A mobile-friendly control web app to allow new drinks to be announced
3. A node application to allow the control app to broadcast changes to the menu

The default menu page displays a full-screen video in the background, displays
the current drink in the upper left, and a small message in the lower right
of the screen. You must supply your own video file, place it in
/app/menu/movies/, and edit the reference to the file in /app/menu/index.html.
